  spec.description = <<~TEXT
    Health Cards implements SMART Health Cards, a secure and decentralized framework that allows 
    people to prove their vaccination status or medical test results. It is built on top of FHIR R4 
    health data exchange standards and Verifiable Credentials. It allows conversion of
    clinical data into JWS which may then be embedded into QR codes, exported to smart-health-card files, or
    returned by a $health-card-issue FHIR operation.
